    <p> Aimed at neurodivergent adults, parents, carers and family members of neurodivergent people, and professionals
        working in the field, this conference will bring national and international speakers to the Isle of Wight to
        share their knowledge and expertise. Around one third of our speakers are neurodiverse themselves, a further
        third are parents or carers of neurodiverse people, and all of our speakers are leaders within their fields.
        <br>
        The conference will be free to attend, but you must book your place. There will be a range of presentations and
        workshops on the day. Individual sessions will be bookable on the day. Due to constraints on numbers we are
        unable to guarantee places on any specific session, but there will be several streams on the day and there will
        always be something of interest!</p>

                    This week is not only Neurodiversity Celebration Week, it is also Mental Health Awareness Week, and
                    so we are kicking off with a neurodivergent speaker who will be presenting on autism and mental
                    health.

                    Krysia is an autistic PhD researcher at the Tizard Centre, where she is funded by the Tizard Centre
                    Scholarship (2018-2023). Her research interests include: autism, attitudes towards neurodivergent
                    people, spirituality of autistic people and faith organisations and accessibility/inclusive
                    practice.

                    We are delighted that Krysia has agreed to join us at Neurodiversity 2019. Her presentation will
                    focus on counselling, mental health and autism.</p>

                    for AIM (Autism Inclusion Matters) and in this role organizes the island’s Autism Partnership Board,

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">Next up is the island’s very own Alex Watts!

                    Alex is the Isle of Wight's most flamboyant pop-culture cheerleader.

                    An international speaker with a heavy case of high-functioning ADHD - Alex attributes all of his
                    adventures to his neurodiverse nature. An advocate for cause and effect, Alex traces his entire
                    adult life to an audacious lie he told when he was 16. From that, he joined international speaker,
                    best-selling author and YouTuber 'The Aspie World' around the world, recorded albums, interviewed
                    his favourite film stars, outsold the Beatles for 20 minutes in Japan, worked for Motorhead - and
                    met his partner of 8 years.

                    Alex's quest for affirmation outside of his constant elation for life has helped him see beyond the
                    diagnosis. He now stares adoringly at the source code of humanity, on a quest to unshackle ADHD and
                    be an example of the positive life one can lead.

                    The talk includes audience participation, video games and a demonstration of an eidetic memory.

                    Alex - we cant wait to welcome you to Neurodiversity IW 2018!

                    ACRE was created to address the gap in provision of employment support for autistic adults without
                    learning disabilities. Over the last 5 years, the ACRE team has been conducting research on
                    employment issues in autism. This work has resulted in the creation of a suite of free online
                    resources to support people on the Autism Spectrum and their employers, including employment
                    Profiling Assessment© Services.

                    Nathan is a qualified teacher and has taught all ages and abilities over the years. He began in
                    special educational needs schools in 2009. After his experience of delivering skills to young
                    autistic people in 2007, he knew he would continue developing his career path. He has worked as a
                    freelance facilitator with his own teaching, outside of a school setting, since 2008. Nathan is
                    currently pursuing a PhD in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities with a focus on using an
                    improv comedy intervention with autistic adults and exploring anxiety. His supervisors are Prof
                    Julie Beadle-Brown and Dr Shaun May. Both supervisors have been involved in autism research with a
                    theatre-based element. Prof Beadle-Brown is a part of the Tizard Centre and was an integral part of
                    the 'Imagining Autism' project. Dr May is part of the School of Arts and has an interest in comedy
                    and autism.

                    Nathan will deliver an improv comedy workshop for autistic participants based on his research being
                    conducted around anxiety. Opportunity to get involved in the research may be possible. The class
                    explores spontaneity and its application to create comedy live. We shall explore thoughts on
                    spontaneity and enhancing the performance of the players through using playfulness in their
                    improvisation.</p>

                <p class="card-text">

                    After a bit of a gap (sorry, we've been so busy behind the scenes though!) we are very excited to
                    announce our next speaker!

                    Mark Brown has worked with children and adults with learning disabilities, autism and many other
                    neuro-developmental conditions for over 30 years in many different capacities, which has included
                    managing a residential long-stay home for adults with behavioural difficulties.

                    In 2010, Mark founded Special Help 4 Special Needs, working directly with children, adolescents and
                    young adults who have a range of diagnoses, and who are all struggling with challenging and/or
                    socially inappropriate behaviour. Mark takes a family-centred approach in all his work, finding
                    workable ways to support the individual within their own family, and a lot of his work is in helping
                    a young person to recognise, understand and regulate their own emotions.

                    Many of the young people he works with have difficulties in interpreting the boundaries of
                    acceptable and unacceptable sexual behaviour, and this work has led him to developing an enhanced
                    sex education course specifically designed for those who may otherwise be at risk of displaying
                    sexually inappropriate behaviour. Mark also runs a social club for adults with learning
                    disabilities, with a strong focus on supporting the individuals to develop social skills and to gain
                    the confidence to use them.

                    Mark will be speaking on puberty & sexuality, & their impact on Autism & Learning Disabilities</p>

                    Chris is a broadcaster and wildlife campaigner, photographer and writer. He graduated from
                    Southampton University with a degree in Zoology and soon after started his career behind the camera
                    as a filmmaker. His break as a TV presenter came in the form of the 1980’s cult ‘Really Wild Show'
                    series’. He has spent most of his career travelling the world to bring the natural world and its
                    conservation challenges to global attention but his main love for wildlife is in his own territory
                    here in the UK - as such he particularly enjoys co-presenting BBC’s Spring, Autumn and Winterwatch.

                    Chris occupies official roles within many charities including The Wildheart Trust (based on the
                    IOW), the RSPB and the National Autistic Society.

                    Chris’s award-winning memoir ‘Fingers in the Sparkle Jar’ and ‘Aspergers and Me’ documentary have
                    helped him raise awareness of autism and use his life experiences to champion neurodiversity. He has
                    recently been awarded a CBE for his services to nature conservation.</p>
